## Meet the Developer




## Project Overview

We have been tasked to utilize the knowledge we have obtained over the past six weeks to create a real-world front-end application that we will showcase to potential employers.

## UX Design

Our website was designed with the user in mind - mimicking the same enviorment we wish for the user to love; a night-in at home.

The open design, although a first iteration, helps the user seamlessly pick their night-in line-up. The dark theme and flourescent composition imitate the bustling night-life, without compromising the cozy mood.
